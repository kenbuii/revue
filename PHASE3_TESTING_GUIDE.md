## 🎯 Critical Test Scenarios

### Integration Testing
1. **Full Comment Flow**:
   - Open Comments Modal → Post Comment → See it appear → Like it → Close modal
2. **Full Likes Flow**:
   - Like a post → Open Likes Modal → See yourself in list → Pull to refresh
3. **Navigation Flow**:
   - Tap media info → Navigate to media detail → Back → Tap post → Navigate to post detail
4. **Error Recovery**:
   - Turn off internet → Try operations → See error messages → Turn on internet → Retry

### Performance Testing
1. **Rapid Interactions**: Quickly tap like/unlike multiple times
2. **Modal Opening**: Open/close modals rapidly
3. **Scrolling**: Scroll through long comment lists
4. **Memory**: Open multiple posts, check for memory leaks
